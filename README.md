# chronoclock_stopwatch

A sleek stopwatch made in Python, featuring a modern UI generated from a Figma design.  
The UI is based on the **Material 3 Design Kit** by Material Design (licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)).

⚠ **Note:** I must admit this is the first version and it doesn’t fu@#@ing work — but I’ll fix that later.

## Features
- **Start/Stop toggle** with a single button  
- **Reset** button to clear time  
- Clean, modern UI 
- Modular logic file for easy customization

## Installation & Running
1. Download this repository as a ZIP and extract it, **or** clone it using Git:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aadidev11/chronoclock_stopwatch.git
   cd chronoclock_stopwatch
   ```
2. Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed (3.10 recommended).  
3. Tkinter should come pre-installed with Python — if not, install it via your system’s package manager.  
4. Run the program:  
   ```bash
   python gui.py
   ```

## Usage
- Click **Start** to begin timing.  
- Click **Stop** to pause.  
- Click **Reset** to return to `00:00:00`.

The stopwatch logic is stored in `stopwatch.py`, making it easy to update or expand functionality.
